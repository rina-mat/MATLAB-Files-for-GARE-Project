# MATLAB-Files-for-GARE-Project

<p> This file contains all the codes written for the reasearch project of Mathematics Department funded by Education Ministry. The project is titled as - <i>"Study on the general mesh generating algorithms and the domain integrals for developing the computer code to solve the two dimensional continuum mechanics problems"</i></p> 
<p> In this project we have developed a few algorithms to generate quadrilateral and cubic meshes of different types of domains such as convex, concave and curved domain including those domains with a hole or holes which are contained in this repository; Thank you.</p>
